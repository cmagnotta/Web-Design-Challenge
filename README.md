In this challenge, I examined the relationship between lattitude and four key weather stats: wind speed, cloud coverage, temperature and humidity. I created a website to display this visualizations that includes a drop down menu and images that are linked to other pages, and that also features a navigational bar. The pages should be responsive and display correctly, no matter the size of the screen.

I added an additional page with a smaller set of data -- only 50 cities -- and added a linear regression to the graph so that one can visualize the relationship better. The data set chosen for that graph was just the cities with the 50 highest temperatures.
